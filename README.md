## Configuration

### Refresh Rate

The plugin updates every second by default. Modify the refresh rate by renaming the main file:
- `system-monitor.1s.rb` - updates every second
- `system-monitor.5s.rb` - updates every 5 seconds
- `system-monitor.1m.rb` - updates every minute

### Network Monitoring Setup

To enable network monitoring without password prompts, add this line to your sudoers file using `sudo visudo`:

```bash
your_username ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/powermetrics
```

## Architecture

The plugin is built with a modular architecture:
- Metrics modules for each monitored resource
- View components for display formatting
- Configuration management
- Error handling and graceful degradation
